      <h1 align="left" id="about-project" class="about-p">About The Project</h1>
      <p align="left" id="project-description" class="about-p">This website project was designed for the Media Arts Web Design class for educational purposes! I chose to use a chocolate chip cookie dough recipe because they're my favorite types of cookies, but sometimes I just want to eat the dough and not have to wait for the actual baking to finish. And who doesn't love cookie dough ice cream? Sometimes that ice cream just need a <i>little</i> extra help!</p>
    <!--About Me, Pharagraph 2 and 3-->
      <h2 align="left" id="about-me">About Me</h2>
      <p align="left" id="aboutMe-description" class="about-p">I am 23 years old, currently a sophomore at the University of Montana, working on getting my degree in Media Arts. I have 2 cats, 2 dogs, enjoy baking, playing video games, and doing graphic design in my free time! Some of my favorite things to bake are cookies, blueberry muffins, banana bread, and cupcakes!</p>
      <p align="left" id="learning" class="about=p"><b>What I learned during this process:</b> A <i>lot</i> of HTML. Despite the fact that I've been messing with HTML related projects on my own for a while, I still learned quite a bit of information I didn't already know. I have a pretty good understanding of most things, but this has really helped clarify a lot of things I wasn't entirely 100% sure about to begin with! It's been super helpful and a lot of fun.</p>

      <!--Media Arts Logo Video-->
      <p>Including the Media Arts animated logo on a Media Arts project just seems right.</p>

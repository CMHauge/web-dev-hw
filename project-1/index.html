      <h1><b>The Naming Of Cats</b></h1>
      <h2><i>By T. S. Eliot</i></h2>
      <p>The Naming of Cats is a difficult matter,<br />
It isn't just one of your holiday games;<br />
You may think at first I'm as mad as a hatter<br />
When I tell you, a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES.<br />
First of all, there's the name that the family use daily,<br />
Such as Peter, Augustus, Alonzo or James,<br />
Such as Victor or Jonathan, George or Bill Bailey--<br />
All of them sensible everyday names.<br />
There are fancier names if you think they sound sweeter,<br />
Some for the gentlemen, some for the dames:<br />
Such as Plato, Admetus, Electra, Demeter--<br />
But all of them sensible everyday names.<br />
But I tell you, a cat needs a name that's particular,<br />
A name that's peculiar, and more dignified,<br />
Else how can he keep up his tail perpendicular,<br />
Or spread out his whiskers, or cherish his pride?<br />
Of names of this kind, I can give you a quorum,<br />
Such as Munkustrap, Quaxo, or Coricopat,<br />
Such as Bombalurina, or else Jellylorum-<br />
Names that never belong to more than one cat.<br />
But above and beyond there's still one name left over,<br />
And that is the name that you never will guess;<br />
The name that no human research can discover--<br />
But THE CAT HIMSELF KNOWS, and will never confess.<br />
When you notice a cat in profound meditation,<br />
The reason, I tell you, is always the same:<br />
His mind is engaged in a rapt contemplation<br />
Of the thought, of the thought, of the thought of his name:<br />
His ineffable effable<br />
Effanineffable<br />
Deep and inscrutable singular Name.</p>

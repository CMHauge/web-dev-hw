# My First README.md

## Chelsey Hauge

**Hello!**

Cool, name taken care of, off to a good start!

**Here's what I've done so far:**

- Reviewed Markdown
- Reviewed HTML

As a side note, I've got some experience with both Markdown and HTML, hence the "reviewed" wording. Although I love that there are new things that I'm already experiencing, like using Atom and Github, neither of which I'm familiar with!

```markdown
Hey, look! A code block. How fancy is that?
These will be super useful in the future.
```
- I also added a fancy screenshot

Also, as a side note, I'm wishing PC folders looked as fancy as Mac; I kind of hate the way they look. I've also always thought that being able to apply colors to our folders would be super neat. I know I can't be the only one that loves organizing by colors, right?

**How I've Been Doing So Far:**

To be completely honest, I was totally lost for the first part of the week. Partly because of my own doing, as life kinda got away from me for a bit, but also partly because I'm so used to using [Moodle](http://moodle.umt.edu) for everything, that it felt weird initially to be switching over to Github.

The good news is I think I have a fairly good grasp on it now, and I'm sure I'll be able to better wrap my head around it as I get settled into a routine and get used to being in school again. (Summer breaks are killer for routine, ya know?)
